  abstract = {We report the development of {GPT}-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, {GPT}-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. {GPT}-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of {GPT}-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of {GPT}-4.},

  abstract  = {We demonstrate that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even becoming competitive with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.  For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model.  {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks. We also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.},

  abstract   = {In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models ({LLMs}), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought ({CoT}) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can {LLMs} reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, {CoT} reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained {LLMs} by simply altering the {\textbackslash}textit\{decoding\} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-\$k\$ alternative tokens, uncovering that {CoT} paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the {LLMs}' {\textbackslash}textit\{intrinsic\} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a {CoT} in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between {CoT} and non-{CoT} paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed {CoT}-decoding effectively elicits reasoning capabilities from language models, which were previously obscured by standard greedy decoding.},
