\section{Transformer}\label{sec:transformer_arch}

The Transformer architecture, introduced by \textcite{vaswani_attention_2017}, performs sequence modeling by relying entirely on self-attention mechanism, instead of using convolution or recurrence.

Let $\mathcal{V}$ denote the vocabulary of input tokens. While the tokens can represent anything, in language modeling tasks they are usually learned subword units. In this work, however, a simple character tokenization scheme is used that is suitable for algorithmic tasks, so each token corresponds to a single character (letter, digit or symbol) in the sequence. An input sequence is represented as $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, where $x_i \in \mathcal{V}$ and $n$ is the sequence length. Each token $x_i$ is mapped to a $d$-dimensional embedding vector $E_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ using an embedding matrix $E \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}| \times d}$. Thus, each row of $E$ corresponds to the embedding of a token in the vocabulary.

The input matrix to a Transformer layer is a sequence of vector embeddings (also called the \emph{latent} or \emph{hidden representation} for intermediate layer inputs), denoted $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $H = [H_1^\top, H_2^\top, \dots, H_n^\top]^\top$. The output of a Transformer layer is also a sequence of vectors with the same sequence length, denoted $O \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$.

In practice, the inputs to the Transformer are batched, so the input has an additional dimension for the batch size, denoted $b$, with $H \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times n \times d}$. This results in the first (batch) dimension being added throughout the intermediate representation and the output, but has no bearing on the description of the Transformer model.

\subsection{Elements}\label{subsec:elements_transformers}

The Transformer is composed of several key components to model dependencies in sequential data: multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections. Informally, the attention mechanism transfers information \emph{between} tokens, while the feed-forward networks process information \emph{within} tokens. These components are stacked in each layer of the Transformer as shown in Figure \ref{fig:transformer_layer} (a).

\paragraph{Token Embeddings}
The discrete input tokens are first converted into continuous embeddings using an embedding matrix $E \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}| \times d}$, where $|\mathcal{V}|$ is the size of the vocabulary and $d$ is the embedding dimension. The embedding matrix is learned during training, and the embeddings are used as input to the Transformer. After applying the Transformer layers, the output embeddings are passed through a linear \emph{unembedding} layer to get the \emph{logits} (unnormalized log-probabilities) for the next token.

\paragraph{Attention Mechanism}
The attention mechanism \parencite{bahdanau_neural_2014} allows the model to weigh the relevance of different positions in the input sequence. For this purpose, it computes \emph{queries}, \emph{keys}, and \emph{values} from the input embeddings and uses them to calculate attention scores. The output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are determined by the attention scores. The names ``queries'', ``keys'', and ``values'' are derived from the context of information retrieval, where the queries are the elements being searched for, the keys are the elements being searched, and the values are the elements being retrieved. In the context of the Transformer, intuitively, the query represents what the current token is ``looking for'' in the sequence, the keys represent what the token at a given position ``offers'' to the current token, and the values are the actual information that the current token ``receives'' from the other tokens.

First, the queries, keys, and values are computed as:
\begin{align*}
    Q & = H W^Q, \\
    K & = H W^K, \\
    V & = H W^V,
\end{align*}
where $W^Q, W^K, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_k}$ are the weight matrices, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the queries, keys, and values. In practice, the convention is to set $d_k = d$, which is the case for the models in this work. Thus, $Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$.

Given queries $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$, the attention output is computed as:
\begin{equation*}
    O_{att} = \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d}} \right) V.
\end{equation*}
where the softmax function is applied along the last dimension, and is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{softmax}(\mathbf{x})_i = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}}.
\end{equation*}

Note that the output of the attention mechanism has the same shape as the input, $O_{att} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$.

\paragraph{Multi-Head Attention}
Multi-head attention extends the attention mechanism with multiple independent \emph{heads} to allow the model to focus on information from different representation subspaces. So, instead of applying attention to the $d$-dimensional queries, keys, and values directly, they are projected into $h$ different $d_{head}$-dimensional subspaces, where $h$ is the number of heads. In this work, the head dimension $d_{head}$ is set to $d/h$, so that the total dimensionality remains $d$. The outputs the heads are concatenated and linearly transformed to the original dimensionality:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{MultiHeadAttention}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, \dots, \text{head}_h) W^O,
\end{equation*}
where $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is the learned output weight matrix, and each head is computed as:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(Q W_i^Q, K W_i^K, V W_i^V),
\end{equation*}
and $W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{head}}$ are the weight matrices for the $i$-th head.

\paragraph{Feed-Forward Networks}

Position-wise feed-forward networks (FFN), also called the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), are applied independently to each position in the sequence:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{FFN}(H_i) = \sigma(H_i W_1 + \mathbf{b}_1) W_2 + \mathbf{b}_2,
\end{equation*}
where $H_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the input vector, $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{\text{ff}}}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}} \times d}$, and $\sigma$ is an activation function such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

\paragraph{Layer Normalization}
Layer normalization \parencite{ba_layer_2016} is applied after each sub-layer over the last (feature) dimension. The $\text{LayerNorm}$ function for a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{LayerNorm}(v) = \frac{v - \mu}{\sigma}\gamma + \beta,
\end{equation*}
where the scale $\gamma$ and bias vector $\beta$ are learned scaling and shifting parameters, and $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of $v$,computed as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \mu    & = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} v_i,                  \\
    \sigma & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} (v_i - \mu)^2}.
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Residual Connections}
Residual connections \parencite{he_deep_2016} are usually applied to ease gradient flow and enable the training of deeper networks. In Transformer models, the residual connections are applied after each sub-layer (self-attention and MLP), followed by a layer normalization. Thus, the output of each sub-layer is:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{SubLayerOutput} = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x} + \text{SubLayer}(\mathbf{x})).
\end{equation*}

The residual connections-based view of the model also enables the concept of a \emph{residual stream}, which is important in mechanistic interpretability. In this alternative view of the model, the residual connections are the main backbone of information flow through the model, with the sub-layers processing the hidden representation tensor $H$ and adding it back to the residual stream.

\paragraph{Block Structure}
The original Transformer introduced in \cite{vaswani_attention_2017} consists of stacked encoder and decoder blocks, each containing multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, along with residual connections and layer normalization. However, different modified architectures have been proposed, such as the encoder-only BERT model \parencite{devlin_bert_2019} and the decoder-only GPT model \parencite{radford_improving_2018}.

    \label{fig:transformer_layer}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Encoder and Decoder Architectures}\label{subsec:types_transformers}

In this section, different Transformer architectures are summarized: encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only models. The original Transformer~\parencite{vaswani_attention_2017} employs an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder transforms input sequences into continuous representations, and the decoder generates output sequences based on these representations and previously generated tokens. Encoder-only models like BERT~\parencite{devlin_bert_2019} focus solely on encoding input sequences into contextual embeddings, making them well-suited for understanding tasks such as text classification and question answering. Decoder-only models, like GPT~\parencite{radford_improving_2018}, generate sequences by predicting the next token based on prior tokens, primarily used for text generation. While both encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures can perform autoregressive sequence generation, decoder-only models are the focus of this work.

\paragraph{Encoder-Decoder}
The original Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et al.~\cite{vaswani_attention_2017} employs an encoder-decoder architecture. In this architecture, the encoder processes an input sequence $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ into a sequence of continuous representations $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)$. The decoder then generates an output sequence $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m)$ by predicting the next token $y_t$ based on the encoder's output and the previously generated tokens.

The encoder consists of a stack of $N$ identical layers, each containing two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The decoder has a similar structure but includes a third sub-layer: the \emph{cross-attention}, also called \emph{encoder-decoder attention}, where the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the keys and values come from the output of the encoder. Hence, the difference between the self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms is that self-attention is usually applied to the same sequence, while cross-attention is applied between two different sequences (e.g. one from the encoder, and one from the decoder). Moreover, the self-attention mechanism in the decoder has a causal mask to prevent attending to ``future tokens'', ensuring output is generated autoregressively.

\paragraph{Encoder-only}
Encoder-only models focus exclusively on encoding the input sequence into a contextual representation without a decoder component. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)~\cite{devlin_bert_2019} is a prominent example of this architecture. BERT utilizes a stack of Transformer encoder layers to produce deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context. This makes encoder-only models particularly well-suited for tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of the input, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.

These models are typically pre-trained on large unlabeled text corpora using self-supervised objectives like masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). The pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks.

\paragraph{Decoder-only}
Decoder-only models generate sequences based on prior tokens and are designed primarily for autoregressive language modeling and text generation tasks. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)~\cite{radford_improving_2018} is a canonical example of a decoder-only architecture. In these models, the Transformer decoder predicts the next token in a sequence by attending to the previous tokens without an encoder component. The encoder is not needed since in a decoder-only Transformer, the input sequence $\mathbf{x}$ is prepended to the decoder input sequence $\mathbf{y}$, and only passed through the decoder layers to autoregressively generate the output sequence. Recent research on language modeling has mostly focused decoder-only models, since they can also be used on other language tasks through prompting, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning. In particular, majority of the latest state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are decoder-only transformers pre-trained on large text corpora.

\bigskip

\paragraph{Encoder-Decoder vs. Decoder-Only} Both model types are capable of autoregressive sequence generation and can be used for a wide range of tasks. The decoder-only models are favored in recent works due to them being simpler and having less inductive bias. However, encoder-decoder models are still widely used in machine translation, robotics, and multi-modal learning tasks. The additional structure in encoder-decoder models, as compared to using a decoder-only model with would-be encoder input sequence prepended to the decoder's input can be summarized as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The input to the encoder passes through more layers (encoder layers) before reaching the decoder.
    \item It is assumed that input and output sequences are sufficiently different to justify using separate parameters for them (encoder and decoder).
\end{itemize}

In summary, the choice of Transformer architecture depends on the specific requirements of the task, though decoder-only models have been more widely used in recent research and are the focus of this work.

\subsection{Recurrent and Looping Architectures}\label{subsec:recurrent_looping}

Multiple Transformer extensions have been proposed that incorporate iterative application of weight-sharing layers, particularly suitable for algorithmic tasks that require reasoning over sequences. The Universal Transformer and Looped Transformer are two such examples that introduce recurrence into the Transformer architecture. There are other modifications the Transformer architecture, a few examples of which include the Memory Transformer \parencite{burtsev_memory_2021}, Recurrent Memory Transformer \parencite{bulatov_recurrent_2022}, and Neural Data Router \parencite{csordas_neural_2021}, but these architectures are not widely adopted in pretrained language models, and are not tested in this work.

\paragraph{Universal Transformer}

The Universal Transformer \parencite{dehghani_universal_2018} introduces recurrence into the Transformer architecture by repeatedly applying the same transformer layers multiple times, in both encoder and decoder parts:
\begin{equation*}
    H^{(t+1)} = \text{TransformerLayer}(H^{(t)}),
\end{equation*}
where $t$ denotes the iteration step. An adaptive computation time (ACT) mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the number of iterations based on the input sequence. The Universal Transformer has been shown to achieve better performance on algorithmic tasks compared to the original Transformer. It is also an interesting extension of the Transformer architecture from theoretical point of view, since it makes the model Turing-complete under certain conditions \parencite{dehghani_universal_2018}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/looped_transformer.pdf}
    \caption{(a) A block of multiple transformer layers used in the looped transformer. (b) Looped decoder-only transformer architecture. The input injection mechanism adds skip connections (arrow around blocks) from the original input sequence to the input of each block.}
    \label{fig:looped_transformer}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Looped Transformer}
Similar to the Universal Transformer, the Looped Transformer \parencite{yang_looped_2023} extends the Transformer by incorporating iterative application of a block of transformer layers. This modification has been shown to perform better than the original, non-recurrent Transformer on algorithmic tasks \parencite{csordas_systematic_2023,yang_looped_2023}. In particular, looped transformer achieves better length generalization on the binary addition task as shown by \cite{fan_looped_2024}. The looped decoder-only transformer architecture is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:looped_transformer}. However, unlike the Universal Transformer, the Looped Transformer is not necessarily encoder-decoder, and might not use the adaptive computation time mechanism.

\subsection{Positional Encoding Schemes}\label{subsec:positional_encoding}

Since the Transformer lacks inherent sequential order, positional encodings are added to input embeddings to provide position information. Though, several recent works have shown that the causal attention mechanism in a decoder-only transformer can also implicitly learn to encode positional information in the absence of explicit positional encodings \parencite{haviv_transformer_2022,zuo_breaking_2024,zhou_transformers_2024}.

\paragraph{Absolute Positional Encoding}\label{subsec:absolute_pos_enc}
The original Transformer \parencite{vaswani_attention_2017} uses additive vectors of same dimensionality as the embeddings to encode the \emph{absolute} positions of the tokens. These vectors could be learned (from a random initialization), or \emph{sinusoidal}, where the latter are defined as:
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{p}_{i,2k}   & = \sin\left( \frac{i}{10000^{2k/d}} \right), \\
    \mathbf{p}_{i,2k+1} & = \cos\left( \frac{i}{10000^{2k/d}} \right),
\end{align*}
for position in the sequence $i$ and dimension $k$. In \cite{vaswani_attention_2017}, the performance difference between learned and sinusoidal positional encodings was found to be insignificant, and the use of sinusoidal encodings is justified by possibility of generalization to longer sequences. In practice, however, absolute positional encodings do not generalize well to sequences longer than the ones seen during training \parencite{press_train_2021}.

\paragraph{Randomized Positional Encodings}\label{subsec:random_pos_enc}
Randomized positional encodings \cite{ruoss_randomized_2023} aim to improve length generalization by simulating longer sequences during training. They randomly select a subset of positions to represent the sequence, enhancing the model's ability to handle sequences of unseen lengths.

\paragraph{Relative Position Encoding}\label{subsec:relative_pos_enc}
Relative position representations \parencite{shaw_self-attention_2018} encode the relative distances between sequence elements directly into the attention mechanism. In RPE, a vector $\mathbf{a}_{i, j} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is learned for each pair of positions $(i, j)$, and added to the keys before computing the attention scores:
\begin{equation*}
    A_{ij} = \frac{\mathbf{q}_i (\mathbf{k}_i + \mathbf{a}_{ij}^K)^\top}{\sqrt{d}}
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{q}_i$ and $\mathbf{k}_j$ are the query and key vectors for positions $i$ and $j$, respectively. Relative position encodings have been shown to improve performance on tasks requiring long-range dependencies \parencite{shaw_self-attention_2018}.

\paragraph{Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi)}\label{subsec:alibi}
ALiBi \parencite{press_train_2021} introduces a linear bias to the attention scores based on the relative positions. For this additive method, the computation of the (pre-softmax) attention logits is modified as:
\begin{equation*}
    A_{\text{ALiBi}}(X) = Q K^\top + B,
\end{equation*}
where the bias matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is computed by the position encoding function $b : \mathbb{N}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, such that the $(i,j)$-th entry of $B$ is $b(i,j)$. The bias function for the relative position encoding is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
    b(i,j) = -r|i - j|
\end{equation*}
where the $r > 0$ is a fixed slope pre-computed for each head.

\paragraph{Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE)}\label{subsec:rope}
RoPE \cite{su_roformer_2024} encodes positions using rotations of the query and key vectors with an angle proportional to their absolute positions before the dot product attention, which results in attention being a function of the relative distance between the tokens, capturing the relative positional information. It is a non-additive relative positional encoding. Works such as \cite{press_train_2021,kazemnejad_impact_2023} show that RoPE also has poor length generalization.

    \label{fig:transformer_training_inference}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Training}

Training involves minimizing a loss function, typically the \emph{cross-entropy loss} for language tasks, using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or AdamW \parencite{loshchilov_decoupled_2018}. The model learns the parameters $\theta$ by backpropagating the loss through the network layers. The cross-entropy loss is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{b} \sum_{i=1}^{b} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log p(x_{i,j} | x_{i,<j}),
\end{equation*}
where $b$ is the batch size, $n$ is the sequence length, and $p(x_{i,j} | x_{i,<j})$ is the probability of token $x_{i,j}$ given the previous tokens $x_{i,<j}$.

\TODO{describe answer-only loss}

\paragraph{Inference}

During inference, the trained model generates outputs by computing the forward pass through the network. For autoregressive models, techniques like beam search may be used to generate sequences.



\section{Mechanistic Interpretability}\label{sec:mech_interp}

\TODO{expand}

Understanding how Transformers make decisions is crucial for interpretability and debugging. Key concepts include:

\paragraph{Residual Stream}

The residual stream in a Transformer accumulates information across layers through residual connections. Analyzing this stream helps in understanding how information is propagated and transformed.

\paragraph{Activation Patching}

Activation patching involves replacing activations in a model with activations from a different context to study causal effects \parencite{olsson_-context_2022}. This technique can identify which components contribute to specific model behaviors.

\paragraph{Logit Lens}

The logit lens method inspects the logits (pre-softmax outputs) at different layers to interpret intermediate representations. It provides insights into how predictions evolve across layers.

\textcite{olsson_-context_2022} investigated "induction heads," attention heads that enable in-context learning by recognizing patterns like repeated sequences.

\section{Realizability}\label{sec:realizability}

\TODO{maybe rename, fill, RASP/RASP-L and  Ahuja and Mansouri paper}

\section{Deep Double Descent}\label{sec:deep_double_descent}

The phenomenon of \emph{deep double descent} refers to the observation that increasing model capacity or training epochs can initially degrade performance before improving it \parencite{nakkiran_deep_2021}. This challenges the traditional bias–variance trade-off, where increasing complexity always leads to overfitting.

\textcite{belkin_reconciling_2019} explored this phenomenon, showing that modern machine learning models can benefit from overparameterization, achieving better generalization even when they perfectly fit the training data.

Understanding deep double descent is important for training Transformers effectively, as it informs decisions about model size and training duration to optimize performance on tasks like integer addition.
